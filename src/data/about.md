# Intro

I am the founder of [Girlopolis](https://www.facebook.com/HackathonForGirls) where our team encourages girls in Armenia to pursue a career in IT or business fields. In 2021, out of 120 participants, I was the only Armenian who was a participant in [Barcelona International Youth Science Challenge (BIYSC)](https://biysc.org/) which was held in Barcelona, Spain. I learned coding when I was 12. I was 14, when I had my first internship as a back-end developer. I know 3 languages: Armenian, English, Russian.
